#  Minesweeper Clone

This project is a **Minesweeper mimic exercise** designed to improve my skills in **DOM manipulation** and **array handling** in JavaScript.

##  Features
- Dynamically generated grid
- Randomly placed mines
- Number hints indicating nearby mines
- Click to reveal tiles
- Flagging system to mark potential mines

##  Technologies Used
- **HTML** for structuring the grid
- **CSS** for styling the board
- **JavaScript** for game logic and event handling (DOM & arrays)

##  How to Play
1. Click a tile to reveal it.
2. If the tile contains a mine, **Game Over!** 
3. If the tile is safe, numbers will indicate how many mines are nearby.
4. Right-click to **flag** a tile if you suspect a mine.
5. Reveal all safe tiles to **win the game**!
